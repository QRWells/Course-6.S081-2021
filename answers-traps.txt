1.RISC-V assembly
1.1 Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0, a1, a2, etc. contain args to functions.
1.2 Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
There is no call to f and g because of the optimization.
1.3 At what address is the function printf located?
0x630
1.4 What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x30
1.5 What is the output?
He110 World
1.6  If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
i = 0x726c6400.
No, the 57616 do not need to change.
1.7 In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? Why does this happen?
code : printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
undefined, since y=(%a2), but a2 could be any value.
